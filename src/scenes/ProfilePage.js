                            <br></br>
                            I like to be involved in all project aspects so want to stay full-stack. Through my experience I have a diverse range of skills and knowledge including agile development, lean delivery, teamworking and much more.

                            <br></br>
                            My coding education focused heavily on testing and best practices, using TDD/BDD to make full stack web apps in Ruby and Javascript. I have exposure to technologies including Ruby-on-Rails, NodeJS, React, MongoDB, Sinatra, SQL, CSS and REST-APIs.

                                            Led a design project to build screens to protect personnel from ballistic debris. Worked with multiple <span className='bold'>stakeholders</span> and carried out a large amount of <span className='bold'>research</span>.  With no internal support a <span className='bold'>self-starter</span> & <span className='bold'>resilient</span> attitude was necessary. <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#ballistic-screens'>See Here</a>.

                                            Identified the source of a mysterious contaminant in hydraulic oil.

Through my <span className='bold'>analysis</span> I identified the contaminant to be Aluminium Oxide, a common manufacturing grit. <a href='https://github.com/kasey-purvor/CV-Software-Developer/blob/main/engineering_portfolio.md#contamination-study'>See Here</a>
